- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm @Gander_7, a Canadian full-time software developer of 10+ years who, somehow, still enjoys to develop in the off hours when I can.
- ðŸ«¶ **Working For**: ResMed
- ðŸ”­ **Working On**: My own TTRPG note database, a Blades in the Dark character sheet manager, and random thoughts here or there.
- ðŸŽ“ **Working With**: C#, python, and React with past experience in TSQL, Java, WLanguage, C++ and old school plain HTML.
- ðŸ‘¯ **Will Help With**: Anything that helps humanity, related to TTRPGS, or related to [Obsidianmd](https://github.com/obsidianmd).
- ðŸŒ± **Learning**: ChatGPT is less helpful with advanced code, the latest enjoyable frameworks, and hopefully more Rust soon.
